# Biocomputation-Genetic-Algorithm

# Description
This project contains genetic algorithms that work by simulating genetic replication and is written in Python. It simulates genetic replication by starting off with initial random genes which will undergo the stages of DNA replication such as mutations and crossing over until finally producing offsprings and these offsprings will start the cycle again which will continue for many generations.
The programs will plateau as it hits the fitness function which is a function used to see how well a given solution performs compared to the optimum solution of the desired problem.
